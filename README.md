# Konekoya's blog

Hi, I blog everything about FrontEnd! Things that I currently have high interest are: React, Redux, Test Driven Development (TDD), webpack, Chrome Developer Tools, Jest and ESlint.

## Development

```sh
yarn start
```

### Lint

```
yarn lint
```

### Format all JS files with prettier

```
yarn format
```

## Build

```sh
yarn build
```

## Deploy

```sh
yarn deploy
```
