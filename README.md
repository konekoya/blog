# Konekoya's blog

Hi, I blog everything about FrontEnd! Things that I currently have high interest
are: React, Chrome Developer Tools, React Hooks, End-to-End test.

## Development

First, install the dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

Start the development server:

```sh
yarn start
```

### Lint

```
yarn lint
```

## Build

```sh
yarn build
```

## Publish blog to GitHub

```sh
yarn deploy
```
