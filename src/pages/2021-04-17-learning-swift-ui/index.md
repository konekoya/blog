## SwiftUI

#### Views vs. modifiers

Views are backbone of all visuals in SwiftUI

Modifiers change how view are displayed (size, color, etc.)

#### Navigation Bar vs. Tab View

- `navigationBarTitle` is deprecated, use `navigationTitle` instead
- `NavigationLink` only works in a `NavigationView`
- Navigation Bar is often used for drilling down (nested contents)

#### Embed

Instead of copy and paste your code in order to wrap something in a container,
you can `cmd` + mouse click and select `embed...` from the dropdown to do so
