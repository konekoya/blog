The primary IDE for ISO/Swift development are Xcode

`cmd` + `r`: Build and run the IOS device simulator

`cmd` + `.`: Stop the simulator

`cmd` + `u`: Run unit tests

`cmd` + `b`: Build the app

`cmd` + `0`: Toggle navigator

- `cmd` + `1`: Open project navigator
- `cmd` + `5`: Open issue navigator

`cmd` + `opt` + `0`: Toggle inspector

`cmd` + `enter`: Only display editor

`cmd` + `shift` + `y`: Toggle debug area

`cmd` + `opt` + `enter`: Toggle canvas

`cmd` + `l`: Open library

#### Open quickly

This is a lot like `cmd` + `p` in the Frontend land

`cmd` + `shift` + `o`: Open the open quickly palette

- You can search not only the file but also the methods or even properties as
  well
- Jump between previous and next search result by using `cmd` + `ctrl` + left
  arrow key or right arrow key
- You can hold the `opt` key with the file you just found to open it in
  assistant editor (split view)

`cmd` + `ctrl` + mouse click (or use `j` key): Jump to definition

- Same like open quickly, you can use `cmd` + `ctrl` + left arrow key or right
  arrow key to jump between files
- Use `cmd` + `opt` + `ctrl` + `j`: You can jump to the definition and open it
  in the assistant editor

`cmd` + `shift` + `[`: Navigate to the previous (on the left hand side) tab

`cmd` + `shift` + `]`: Navigate to the next tab

#### Fix code indentation

Select everything with `cmd` + `a` and then hit `ctrl` + `i`

#### Move lines

`cmd` + `opt` + `[`: Move current line up one line

`cmd` + `opt` + `]`: Move current line down one line

#### Jump bar

- `ctrl` + 6: Open the Jump bar, you can use arrow key to cycle thru content
- You can type keyword to filter jump bar content while the Jump bar is active
- `MARK`, `TODO`, `FIXME` are keywords that you can add in your source code and
  these keywords will be listed and selectable in the Jump bar

#### Minimap

- `cmd` + `ctrl` + `shift` + `m`: Toggle minimap
- `MARK` can be seen on minimap
